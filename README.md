# BountyBoard

Decentralized Task Bounty Board

What is it?
•⁠  ⁠It is a blockchain-based platform where users can post tasks or bounties (rewards) that others can complete to earn Algorand tokens.

How does it work?
1.⁠ ⁠A user (task creator) posts a task with a description, difficulty level, and reward amount.
2.⁠ ⁠Another user (task solver) claims the task and works on it.
3.⁠ ⁠Once completed, the solver submits proof of completion.
4.⁠ ⁠A smart contract verifies the completion and automatically transfers the reward to the solver.

Key Features:
•⁠  ⁠Task Posting: Users can create tasks with specific requirements and rewards.
•⁠  ⁠Task Claiming: Interested users can accept and complete tasks.
•⁠  ⁠Smart Contract Verification: Ensures fair and transparent reward distribution.
•⁠  ⁠Secure Payments: Rewards are stored and released automatically via blockchain.

Why is it Useful?
•⁠  ⁠Eliminates the need for intermediaries.
•⁠  ⁠Provides a fair and trust way to earn rewards.
•⁠  ⁠Ensures security and transparency using blockchain technology.

It’s like a freelancing platform (e.g., Fiverr or Upwork) but fully decentralized, where everything is managed by smart contracts.
